## DESCRIPTION

This software simulate seismic wave propagation by
solving equations of motion with constitutive equations of elastic/viscoelastic
medium by finite difference method (FDM) under message passing interface (MPI)
environment in 3D and 2D (P-SV or SH) media.

This package also provides a set of tools for visualizing/converting simulation
output.
